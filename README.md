Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Introduction

This project visualizes various sorting algorithms using matplotlib in Python. The visualization helps in understanding how different algorithms sort a list of random values by animating their sorting process. 
The project supports several sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

Features

Bubble Sort: Swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time.

Selection Sort: Selects the minimum element and swaps it with the current position.

Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges them.

Quick Sort: Partitions the array around a pivot and sorts the partitions.

Usage

->Run the Program: Execute the program to visualize the sorting algorithms.

->Choose Algorithm: Select the sorting algorithm by entering the corresponding letter:

          b for Bubble Sort
          
          i for Insertion Sort
          
          s for Selection Sort
          
          m for Merge Sort
          
          q for Quick Sort

->Pause/Resume Animation: Click the 'Pause' button to pause or resume the animation. The button is located at the top-right corner of the plot.

Requirements

->Python 3.x

->matplotlib library
